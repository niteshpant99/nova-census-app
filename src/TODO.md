/**
 * Future Improvements post MVP
 * 
 * Department Handling:
 * - Create a shared types module for department structures
 * - Create a departments table in database
 * - Add proper constraints and validation
 * - Build department management UI for admins
 * - Consolidate department logic into a single service
 * 
 * Current approach works for MVP because:
 * - Department structure is simple and static
 * - Only one sub-department (cabin under post-op)
 * - Changes require developer intervention anyway
 * - Focus is on getting core functionality working
